# RandomProjects
Small one off projects that aren't big enough to go elsewhere


1. Wine counter - Wine counter is a project I made using Google Sheets Scripting. It takes a sheet I made that depicts all of the wineries in a specific area and counts up all the listed red or white wines to create an overall number for each winery. 
2. Madrona Checker - This project was a simple web scraper that allowed me to do work, while I waited for a registration page to pop up.
3. Madrona Hotel Checker - Same as above, but for the hotel instead of the class registration. Outcome: Hotel dropped 5 minutes after class registration.
